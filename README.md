# Cambridge University Robotics Policy Learning Research

## Introduction

This is CUR's research project repository. We are currently working on a reinforcement learning project, where we use
residual and transfer learning to train a physical ```Firefly``` arm.

## Project Structure

There are a lot of old folders, and the important ones are:

```
cur_policy_learning_research
├── physical_arm_learning
│   └── r12
└── simulation
    └── dm_control_cur
```

```r12``` is the library for interfacing with the ```Firefly``` arm, and ```dm_control_cur``` contains all the
simulation code.
